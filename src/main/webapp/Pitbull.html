            The pit bull dog are often used to fight, and to take part in blood sport activities including bull baiting, ratting and illegal dog fighting, just to entertain the public. 
            They became working dogs herding and guarding livestock and other domestic tasks around farms and busy homes and companion dogs. 
            In fact, during the two world wars, pit bulls were portrayed as the nation's mascot, used on recruitment posters and advertising campaigns.
