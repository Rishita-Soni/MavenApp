            The pit bull dog types are descendants of Old English Bulldogs, which date back to the United Kingdom in the 1800s. 
            They were often used to fight, and to take part in blood sport activities including bull baiting, ratting and illegal dog fighting, just to entertain the public. 
            The story goes that as the dogs were needed to be more agile and athletic, they were cross-bred with terriers, leading to the emergence of the Pit Bull Terrier.
            The role and perception of the pit bull changed and developed when the breed migrated to the US. 
            They became working dogs herding and guarding livestock and other domestic tasks around farms and busy homes and companion dogs. 

            The Pit Bull Terrier became known as the American Pit Bull Terrier, and eventually one of the most popular breeds in the US. 
            In fact, during the two world wars, pit bulls were portrayed as the nation's mascot, used on recruitment posters and advertising campaigns.
