            Siberian Husky, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. 
            These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. 
            An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.
